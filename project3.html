            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text">
                This project was done using supervised machine learning to classify the status of loans within a dataset as healthy or high-risk.
                defaults through the use of a Logistic Regression Model. The was used to ideentify loans that
                are likely to be healthy and loans that are likely to default from a dataset of loan borrower information.
                This main variable used to make predictions was a field named 'loan status'. 
            </p>
            <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text2">
                
                The financial information in the dataset includes the loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, 
                number of accounts, derogatorry marks, total debt and loan status. The loan status was key in 
                identifying whether a loan would be healthy or at high-risk for defaulting.
            </p>
            <h2>Machine Learning Process</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text">
                    • Read the csv file into a pandas dataframe to view its contents.<br>
                    • Seperated the target variable of loan status (y) from the features (X).<br>
                    • Split the data into training and testing sets using Train-Test-Split where the training set trains the model and the testing set evaluates the performance of the model.<br>
                    • Used a logistic regression model and fit the model using the training data.<br>
                    • The performance of the model was evaluated through a confusion matrix and classification report.<br>
                    • The confusion matrix provided insights into the number of true positives, true negatives, false positivesm and false negatives.<br>
                    • The classification report provided insights about the precision, recall, F1-score, and support.<br>
        
            </p>
            <h2>Model Performance</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text2">
              
                The logistic regression model was extremely accurate in predicting healthy loans. 
                This means that the model would be perfectly accurate in predicting loans that would not default. 
                The model was also quite accurate in predicting high-risk loans, but with a slightly lower accuracy percentage. 
                Therefore, logistic regression would be a strong pick for predicting healthy and high risk loans.
