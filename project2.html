            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text">
                This project was done using unsupervised learning, specifically with K-means clustering. The goal of this project was to segment customers based on 
                key features such as lead time or the length of their stay. The main objective was to identify customer segments to develop a marketing strategy 
                to appeal to different customer types based on their booking behaviors.
             
        
            <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text">
               <strong>Cleaning the Hotel CSV File with Excel Power Query</strong><br><br>
                    • Filtered out the values with "0" in the no_of_adults due to it representing a small portion of the dataset and not knowing whether or not this is representative of an error. Usually hotel bookings need adults present to book a hotel room.<br>
                    • Checked for null and missing values.<br>
                    • Converted the type_of_meal_plan column to the numeric data type and changed the values to 0, 1, or 2 based on the condition in the original column(0 = not selected, 1 = meal plan 1, 2 = meal plan 2).<br>
                    • Converted the room_type_reserved column and created a new column to only display the number of the room type and not the words and number. Converted the data type to whole number.<br>
                    • Combined the weekday and week night columns into a total nights stayed column.<br>
                    • Made a new column to display the total price by multiplying the average room price on total nights stayed column.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>K-Means Clustering and Analysis in Jupyter Notebook</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text2">
               <strong>Analysis with Python</strong><br><br>
               • Selected numeric features/columns for clustering.<br>
               • Standardized the features using SKLearn standard scaler.<br>
               • Used Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the scaled features.<br>
               • Calculated Silhouette Scores to see what amount of clusters would be optimal for clustering.<br>
               • Also calculated the inertia and used the elbow method to choose the right amount of clusters.<br>
               • Applied K-Means to three cluster groups.<br>
               • Calculated the mean for cluster groups.<br>
               • Used seaborn to create boxplots for lead time and total nights distribution amonst cluster groups.<br>

            <h2>Customer Segmentation Based on Booking Lead Times and Stay Length</h2>
            <p class="rectangle-text2">
            <strong>Customers With A Short Stay and Moderate Lead Time</strong><br><br>
            • Advertise short getaway packages or weekday deals.<br>
            • Market convenient booking options with multiple ways to book.<br>
            • Offer added services free of charge like free breakfast and express check-in and check-out.<br><br>
            <strong>Customers With A Long Stay and Varied Lead Time</strong><br><br>
            • Offer booking discounts and/or loyalty programs for extended stays.<br>
            • Promote packages that include extra amenities like free meal plans, free access to a spa center, or complementary laundry services.<br>
            • Offer both early booking specials and last minute deals to appeal to different booking behaviors.<br>
            • Advertise bundles that include special offers to local attractions.<br><br>
            <strong>Customers With A Short Stay and Short Lead Time</strong><br><br>
            • Highlight last-minute "Hot" deals.<br>
            • Use ads and push notifications to reach nearby users who may be seeking to book at the last minute.<br>
            • Offer flexibility when booking such as free cancellations and an option to change their booking dates.<br><br>
